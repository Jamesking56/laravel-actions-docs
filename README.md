# Laravel Actions
âš¡Laravel components that take care of one specific task

This package introduces a new way of organising the logic of your Laravel applications by focusing on the actions your application provide.

Similarly to how VueJS components regroup HTML, JavaScript and CSS together, Laravel Actions regroup the authorisation, validation and execution of a task in one class that can be used as an **invokable controller**, as a **plain object**, as a **dispatchable job**, as an **event listener** and as an **artisan command**.
